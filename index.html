            I’m Ruben Leonard Fernandes — software engineer, author, poet, 
            songwriter and music producer from Bengaluru, India. While pursuing 
            engineering I’ve built E-Commerce websites, day-to-day useful sites, 
            web apps and retro games, and I spend every 
            spare moment writing books and making music. One of my most notable software 
            projects is <strong>“Space Chase"</strong>, a 2D retro game that is easy to 
            play but challenging as the game progresses. Throughout my software projects 
            I have constantly showcased my:<br><br>
            - Programming skills<br>
            - Problem-solving skills<br>
            - Decision-making skills<br>
            - Analytical skills<br><br><br>
            My debut single <strong>“Be Mine”</strong> 
            is out under my stage name <strong>Radiowave</strong>. Also, my first crime-fiction 
            novel, <strong>“The Coleman’s Story - Run From the Gun"</strong> 
            is published with Clever Fox Publishing House.

        <p><strong>Synopsis of "The Coleman's Story - Run From The Gun"</strong></p><br>
        <p>Elton Coleman, once a bank accountant in Chicago, is crushed by debt, failure, and desperation. Behind his façade as a devoted husband and father, he hides secrets—extra jobs, lies about money, and a mounting sense of doom. One night, driven by despair and twisted logic, Elton sedates his family—wife Sarah, mother Evelyn, and daughters Emily, Olivia, Sophia—before murdering them all with chilling precision.</p><br>
        <p>He stages the crime scene, misleads investigators with a fake phone trail, and escapes under a new identity: James Park. Crossing borders through India, Bangladesh, and Thailand, James buries Elton Coleman and rebuilds his life in Bangkok, starting a restaurant and earning a fresh identity through Somchai, a fixer with a dark past shaped by his life with his police-officer father.</p><br>
        <p>Eight years later, retired detective Winston Bell visits Bangkok and notices cracks in James's façade. Suspicion grows as Bell digs into James's erased past, sensing the truth beneath the calm surface. James, haunted yet methodical, prepares backup escape plans, unwilling to be caught but reluctant to run again.</p><br>
        <p>The story weaves guilt, survival, and identity with psychological tension, showing how the past always resurfaces. Elton Coleman may have killed his family and become James Park, but the question lingers: can a man truly escape himself, or does the weight of his sins always find him?</p>
